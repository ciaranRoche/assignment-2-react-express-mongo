First track is the title track, which is also the longest track on the album, being just over 12 minutes in length. And the album couldn’t start better. After a gentle opener this track just builds up on the fuzz and heavy low-end riffing and slowly introduces more and more elements to the music. Thomas Jäger’s vocals are very good and perhaps initially a bit surprising on first listen. So many doom bands I’ve listened to lately employ the more heavier grunting or more shouting vocal style, while Jäger’s vocals are very spacey, nicely produced by the use of some echoey effects. It’s giving the music a very hypnotic effect.",
